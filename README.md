## Project Idea

Matching people with similar interest.

## Use cases

People would attends meetup events that intrigues them. Take myself as example, I would attend meetup events that are related to Java, Spark and **Cooking**. Not only am I interested in learning about the topics that being shared at those events, but also meeting with people sharing same interest and discuss with them. In this project, I am creating people recommendation.
